Since yesterday, I have been developing a Bluetooth master controller for Windows Phone. Even though this isnâ€™t my first app, This is going to be my first app on Windows Phone store.

Unlike other Bluetooth controller apps available in the Windows Phone store, This app can both send and receive commands. Testing with Arduino Uno clone turned out to be great. This app should come in handy, if you plan for two-way communication between microcontrollers and Windows Phone devices.

So far, Most programming part of the app is complete. A few bug fixes and optimization are left. Hopefully, this app will be available for download from the Windows Phone by next week.
