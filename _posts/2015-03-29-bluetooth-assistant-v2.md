I have released a new update to Bluetooth Assistant, this time itâ€™s version 2.0.0.0. In this release, several bugs have been fixed and most importantly I have added the support for customizable key layouts.

### v2.0.0.0 Changelog: {#v2000changelog}

  * Added customizable layouts
  * Added menu item to rate the app
  * Fixed bubble selection issue in terminal
  * Fixed several bugs affecting performance

On a side note, Bluetooth assistant has already crossed 2K downloads, with an average of 200 downloads/day. I am glad that people found my app useful.
