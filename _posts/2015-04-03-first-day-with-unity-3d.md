Lately, I have been obsessed with game development. So, I thought of giving Unity 3D, the popular game engine, a shot. The first day experience with Unity 3D turned out to be great.

The only other game engine I have ever used was Game Maker from YoYo. After installing Unity 3D, I realized how powerful Unity 3D can be. The thing that made me to choose Unity 3D in the first place is the ability to write code in C#.

At present, working on a 2D game. Not sure if I would make it public. Anyway, Iâ€™ll be sticking with 2D game development, for some time.
