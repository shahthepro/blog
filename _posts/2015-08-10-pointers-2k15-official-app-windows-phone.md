[Pointers 2K15](http://www.arunai.org/pointers) is a national-level technical symposium conducted by the Computer Science and Engineering Department of [Arunai Engineering College](http://www.arunai.org/), Tiruvannamalai.

With everyone in the department working hard to make Pointers 2K15 a success, Here comes a small contribution from my side. Yes, as the title says, It’s a simple app for Windows Phone users with which they can know about Pointers 2K15.

I have been involved in the development of Official Pointers 2K15 App for Windows Phone since a couple of days.  <del>I have submitted the app to the Windows Phone Store and now it is awaiting approval. Once approved, Will share the link to the app here on my blog</del>.

P.S. You can read more about [Pointers 2K15 here](http://www.arunai.org/pointers) and if you’re willing to participate, you can pre-register too.

**Update:** App now available on Windows Store. Check [this post](/pointers-2k15-windows-store).
