# A Quick Rewind
My first presence on social network dates more than a decade back to the _Orkut era_. If commnunity forums can be considered as social networks, it goes even back in time to mid 2000's. 

I still remember creating multiple accounts on forums like _Hostbidder_ & _VBForums_ and getting banned, again and again, for being a nasty troll. _VBForums_, _Planet Source Code_ and _SourceForge_ were my _StackOverflow_ back when I started programming circa 2005-2006.

To be honest, I enjoyed spending time on community forums that I did on social networks. And I still do. I have even tried creating social networks and community forums.

# Flash-forward to now
Until recently I have had account on almost all major social networks and tech forums. But I've been inactive on almost all of them for a while now.

Perhaps I am fed up with all the social networks and forums. Or the people using it.

I have taken down my accounts on almost all other social networks other than _Twitter_ and _Reddit_. The leftouts, if any, are because I don't care/remember that I have an account. This applies to Messaging platforms like _WhatsApp_, _Telegram_ and _Discord_ too.

**TL;DR** *Don't* try to get in touch with me through social networks.
