I'm sorry for what I have done to you. I shouldn't have done that. I should have accepted for what you are. That damned over-confidence in me, it made me think that I can fix you.

It has been exactly a thousand days since you became my companion. Never I have ever thought our journey would end this soon.

I should have let you go a long time ago but there was no one as perfect as you were for me. I have pushed you to your limits. I have abused you. Yet you were always there for me. 

When you refused to eat properly and with your health constantly deteriorating, I should have taken you to a doctor. Being an idiot that I am, I thought I could save you myself. 

Now that the surgery has failed, your breath has stopped for once and forever. And the blood is on my hands.

You lived the shortest time of all. But you will be in my memory for years to come.

In your name and honour, I'm not going to find a replacement for you anytime soon. 

You'll be missed, *iPhone SE*. Rest in peace with the Champ and the Lumia 520.
