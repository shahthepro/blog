Yet another freak that loves to code. Passionate about programming and does it as a profession. Perhaps programming is the only thing he knows.

Clumsy, aimless and purposeless human<sup>[?]</sup> being that prefers to spend time alone. Makes communicating harder on purpose<sup>[?]</sup>.

And the name is **Shahul Hameed**.
